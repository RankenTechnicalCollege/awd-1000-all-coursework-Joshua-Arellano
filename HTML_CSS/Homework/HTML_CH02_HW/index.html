<h3>My Hobby is Skateboarding</h3>

  <div>
    <main>
     <p>I like Skateboarding because it is very creative with what you can do as you could skate on a street and jump off of stuff or ollie on a rail, while skating vert opens up much more stuff you can do and the possibilities are limitless. Skating with friends is the best though and I like to at night in the city because you can skate huge drops on roads.</p>
